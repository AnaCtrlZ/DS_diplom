# Кабели силовые на номинальное напряжение до 3 кВ

## TECHNICAL DATA

### APPLICATION AND INTENDED USE  
Kilns are designed for the transmission and distribution of electrical energy in stationary installations at a frequency of 50 Hz or under constant voltage conditions: 
- 0.66 kV; 
- 1 kV.

They can be laid without heating up to temperatures as low as −30°C.

The cables are intended for group laying within cable structures, outdoor power stations (cable bridges, galleries).

Cables with an "ng(FRXL)" execution remain functional during flame exposure for 180 minutes.

Materials used ensure that the cable remains resistant to temperature drops down to −60°C outside its operating environment.

**Hazard class according to GOST 31565 P1b.1.2.5.4**

## CONSTRUCTION  

### Conductor  
Bronze single-strand or multi-stranded round or sector-shaped wire, Class I/II per GOST 22483, cross-sectional area from 1.5 mm² to 2 x 1000 mm². 

For VBG-Pn(g)(A)-FRXL cables:
- Single strand up to 16 mm², circular shape, Class I per GOST 22483.

### Thermal Barrier  
Two glass-silvered tapes.

### Insulation  
Polyvinyl chloride plastic material with reduced flammability (color-coded identification on each conductor).  

### Bundling  
Multi-conductors bundled together while two-, three-, four-, five-, six-wire bundles lie parallelly in one plane.

### Inner Sheath  
Polyvinyl chloride plastic material with reduced flammability filled between conductors.

### Shielding  
Steel tape wound spirally around the cable for VBG-Epn(g)(A)-FRXL cables.

### Armor  
Spiral-placed steel galvanized sheets applied over the armor layer for VBSwn(g)(A)-FRXL cables.

### Outer sheathing  
Polyvinyl chloride plastic material with reduced flammability.
